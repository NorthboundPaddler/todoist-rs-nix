# todoist-rs-nix

A nix package for [todoist-rs](https://github.com/illiteratewriter/todoist-rs), a Todoist CLI client. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Currently, this package only builds for the `x86_64-linux` platform, as that's all I need. I also am only going to update the `todoist-rs` version when I see a new feature or bug-fix I need. Therefore, don't expect many/any updates.
